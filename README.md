# Velocity Railways

## Business Introduction

Velocity Railways is a leading railway operator based in the United Kingdom, dedicated to providing efficient, reliable, and timely train services across the nation. The company leverages cutting-edge technology and real-time data integration to ensure its customers receive up-to-the-minute information on train schedules, departures, and arrivals.

## Problem Statement

Velocity Railways is currently facing challenges in providing accurate and real-time train departure information to its passengers. The current system provides scheduled departure times but often lacks real-time updates on delays, cancellations, or other disruptions. The company aims to create a better pipeline that fetches real-time data from a source and saves it in a database for further use.

## Objectives

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Implement a system to fetch real-time data on train departures, delays, and cancellations.
- **Database Management**: Store the real-time data in a robust and accessible database.
- **Customer Updates**: Ensure passengers receive timely and accurate information about their train journeys.

## Proposed Solution

1. Provide accurate real-time train departure information by integrating a data source that provides scheduled timetables and real-time train movements.
2. Ensure high data quality using a robust validation framework that dynamically adapts to changes in data sources and formats.
3. Be fault-tolerant and highly available, ensuring the system can seamlessly failover to backup systems (local PostgreSQL) if the primary system (Azure PostgreSQL) fails.
4. Enable real-time data processing to support dynamic dashboards, anomaly detection, and decision-making.
5. Orchestrate complex data flows that support real-time data enrichment, processing, validation, and storage in a reliable, scalable manner.

## Technologies Used

- **Requests**: For making HTTP requests to fetch real-time data.
- **Great Expectations**: To validate and ensure high data quality.
- **Airflow**: For orchestrating data workflows and ensuring data processing pipelines.
- **Azure**: As the cloud platform for hosting and managing services.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database management, both locally and on the cloud.
- **Python**: As the primary programming language for developing and integrating various components.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Identify Data Sources**: Determine reliable sources for real-time train data.
2. **API Integration**: Set up APIs to fetch data from identified sources.
3. **Database Setup**: Configure a database to store real-time data.
4. **Data Processing**: Ensure the data is processed and updated in real-time.
5. **User Interface**: Create an interface for passengers to access the information.

## Future Enhancements

- **Predictive Analytics**: Use historical data to predict potential delays and provide proactive updates to passengers.
- **Mobile Application**: Develop a mobile app for passengers to receive updates on the go.
